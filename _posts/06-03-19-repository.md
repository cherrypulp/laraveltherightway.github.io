##  Repository Pattern {#repository}

The idea with this pattern is to have a generic abstract way for the app to work with the data layer without being bothered what storage technology is used when saving/retrieving the data.

> We suggests to check first this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@jsdecena/refactor-the-simple-tdd-in-laravel-a92dd48f2cdd){:target="_blank"} for in-depth understand about this design pattern.

### When reading/writing data, it is RECOMMENDED to wrap it into Repository Object

We use this helper package to help us create our Repository

```
